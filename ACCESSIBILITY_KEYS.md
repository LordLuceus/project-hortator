# Project Hortator — Complete Key Reference

Every key the accessibility layer adds or changes, grouped by where you use it.
The readme covers the essentials; this goes through the lot. If you find a key
that works but isn't written down here, that's a bug in this document — please
report it.

Two things to know before the tables:

- **Keys mean different things in different places.** `Delete` drops an item in
  your inventory but deletes a spell in the magic window. Each section below says
  where its keys apply, and **Keys that mean different things** at the end lists
  the overlaps in one place.
- **While you are typing in a text box, almost all of these stop working.** Text
  boxes take every key so you can type freely. Press **Escape** to finish
  editing, and the keys below come back.

## Anywhere in the game world

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **H** | Open / close the accessible HUD (pauses the world) |
| **Alt + H** | Read your health |
| **Alt + M** | Read your magicka |
| **Alt + F** | Read your fatigue |
| **Shift + Alt + H** | Read the current target's health |

The quick health / magicka / fatigue keys work while the HUD is open too.

---

## Scanning and targets

The world is grouped into categories (actors, doors, containers and so on). You
pick a category, then cycle through what's in it, nearest first. Whatever is
selected is your **target**.

The scanner starts on **All**, which is every interactable thing around you in
one list — actors, doors, containers, items and activators together, nearest
first. It's the quickest way to survey an unfamiliar room. Switch to a single
category when you want to ignore everything else: "where are the doors out of
here" is a much shorter list than "what is in this room".

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Page Down / Page Up** | Next / previous target in the current category. Hold to run through a long list |
| **Ctrl + Page Down / Page Up** | Next / previous category |
| **Shift + Page Down / Page Up** | Cycle the subcategory filter (e.g. Plants / Storage within Containers) |
| **Ctrl + 0 … 9** | Jump straight to a category: 0 All, 1 Actors, 2 Doors, 3 Containers, 4 Items, 5 Activators, 6 Detected, 7 Waypoints, 8 Locations, 9 Terrain |
| **Home** | Announce the current target again |
| **Backspace** | Back to the first (nearest) target in the category |
| **End** | Clear the selection |
| **/** | Search: filter the current category by name, a door's destination, or any note you've attached with Ctrl + K |
| **Ctrl + /** | Clear the search filter |
| **Ctrl + Up** | Direction filter: show only what lies the way you're facing, and keep following you as you turn. Press again to switch off |

Four categories only appear while they have something in them: **Detected**
(while a Detect effect is revealing something), **Waypoints** (once you have a
map note or a Mark), **Locations** (once you have discovered a named place) and
**Terrain** (in a cell with damaging terrain or a levitation shaft). Cycling with
Ctrl + Page Down skips them when they are empty, so the ring you hear is often
shorter than ten. Their **Ctrl + number** keys always work regardless, and
announce "0 in range" when there is nothing there — so use Ctrl + 6 … 9 to check
a category rather than assuming it is missing.

---

## Acting on the target

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Enter** | Face the target |
| **Shift + Enter** | Auto-walk to the target |
| **Ctrl + Enter** | Toggle the audio beacon on the target |
| **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** | Teleport to the target — a last resort, not fast travel. Warns you to explore properly first and asks you to confirm (you can turn the warning off once you've read it). Limited to about 58 metres, and unavailable during character creation. Followers in range come with you |
| **Space** | Activate the target (open, take, talk). With nothing selected, works as normal Activate |
| **X** | Toggle lock-on to the target, so you stay aimed at it |
| **Shift + X** | Engage: jump to the nearest hostile and lock on, in one press |
| **K** | Mark / unmark the target as "already looked at" |
| **Ctrl + K** | Attach or edit a note on the target (e.g. labelling a caravaner). Notes are searchable with **/** |
| **Shift + K** | Cycle which objects you see: all → unmarked only → marked only → all |
| **I** | Inspect the target's hidden state — says whether a one-shot mechanism has "Already used" or is "Not used yet", then reads out script values such as whether a lever is on or off. Says "has no readable state" if there's nothing to report |

Your forward, back, left or right movement keys cancel auto-walk. Jumping,
sneaking and turning do not, and neither does Space (so you can walk to a door
and open it on arrival).

---

## Information and orientation

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **L** | Announce your location (cell name) |
| **Ctrl + L** | Announce which way you're facing |
| **Shift + L** | Announce your height above the ground, or depth underwater |
| **Alt + L** | Announce the time of day and date |
| **Ctrl + Left / Right** | Snap your facing to the previous / next compass point |
| **Ctrl + Down** | Turn around 180 degrees |
| **Shift + Up / Down** | Aim your view up / down a step, through five fixed stops (straight up, up, level, down, straight down). Use it to fly with Levitation, or surface and dive while swimming |
| **Shift + Home** | Snap your view back to level |
| **N** | Drop a named map note at your position |

---

## The accessible HUD

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **H** | Open / close |
| **Up / Down** | Move through your stats and status |
| **Enter** | On the active-effects row, open the list of individual effects |
| **Left** | Back out of the effects list |
| **Escape** | Back out of the effects list, or close the HUD |
| **Home** | Re-read the current row |

The scanner and quick-info keys keep working while the HUD is open, with two
exceptions: plain **Enter** and plain **Home** belong to the HUD itself (Enter
opens the effects row, Home re-reads the current row). The modified Enter
combinations — Shift for auto-walk, Ctrl for the beacon, Ctrl + Shift for
teleport — still reach the scanner as usual.

---

## Menus, lists and dialogs

These work in every accessible menu and window unless that window says otherwise.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Previous / next option |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Jump to the previous / next section |
| **Home / End** | Jump to the first / last option |
| **Left / Right** | Change the focused option's value |
| **Enter** or **Space** | Activate the option — open a submenu, run the action, or start editing a text box |
| **T** | Cycle the extra detail lines for the focused option (an item's weight, value and so on) |
| **Shift + T** | Cycle those detail lines backwards |
| **R** | Repeat the last spoken passage or prompt (a conversation line, a journal page, a Yes/No question). Not the menu row you're on — arrow off it and back for that |
| **Escape** | Close the window |
| **Tab / Shift + Tab** | Switch between panes shown side by side (Stats, Inventory, Magic, Map; a container and your inventory; a companion and your inventory; a merchant and your inventory) |

When a submenu is open:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move between the submenu's items |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Jump to the previous / next section within the submenu (for example between the sources of your active effects) |
| **Home / End** | Jump to the first / last item |
| **T** / **Shift + T** | Cycle the extra detail lines for the focused item, forwards / backwards |
| **Escape** or **Left** | Close the submenu and go back to the option it came from |
| **Enter / Space** | Activate the item, if it does anything |

---

## Typing in a text box

Press **Enter** on a text option to start editing; you'll hear "Editing. Press
Escape when done." **Escape** finishes. While editing, every key goes to the text
box — other shortcuts are inert until you press Escape.

| Key | What you hear |
| --- | --- |
| **Left / Right** | The character you moved onto or over |
| **Home / End** | The character at the start / end |
| **Up / Down** | The line you moved to (or the whole contents, in a single-line box) |
| **Backspace / Delete** | The character removed |
| Typing or pasting | The text that was inserted |

Empty positions read as "blank"; spaces, tabs and line breaks are spoken by name.

---

## Conversations

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move between topics and options |
| **Enter** | Choose the focused topic or option |
| **Ctrl + Down / Up** | Jump to the next / previous topic you haven't exhausted yet. Says "No more topics." when there are none left |
| **D** | Announce the character's disposition toward you |
| **R** | Re-read what was just said |

When something a character says opens up a new topic, it is announced right after
their line -- "New topic: Caius Cosades." Several at once are read out together,
and a long list is shortened to the first few and a count. You no longer have to
scroll the topic list after every answer to notice that a lead has appeared.

---

## Inventory, containers and companions

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move through the items |
| **Enter** | Take, store, equip or use the focused item — whole stack |
| **Shift + Enter** | The same, but ask how many first. Applies when moving items to or from an open container or companion; bartering always asks, and equipping from your own inventory always takes the whole stack |
| **T** | Cycle the item's details (weight, value, condition, effects) |
| **Ctrl + Left / Right** | Cycle the category filter: All, Weapon, Apparel, Magic, Misc |
| **Delete** | Drop the focused item (asks how many for a stack). Bound and conjured items can't be dropped |
| **E** | Announce your encumbrance and armour rating |
| **Tab / Shift + Tab** | Switch between your inventory and the container, companion or merchant |

In a companion's inventory, **E** reads *their* encumbrance instead, and their
running profit or loss if they work for a fee.

---

## Buying and selling

These work on both sides of a barter — your inventory and the merchant's.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Enter** | Add the focused item to the deal |
| **B** | Announce the running balance — what you'd pay, or what you'd receive |
| **G** | Announce your gold |
| **Shift + G** | Announce the merchant's gold |
| **=** or **numpad +** | Raise your offer by 1 |
| **Shift + =** or **Shift + numpad +** | Raise your offer by 100 |
| **-** or **numpad -** | Lower your offer by 1 |
| **Shift + -** or **Shift + numpad -** | Lower your offer by 100 |
| **C** | Type an exact offer amount |
| **O** | Make the offer |

---

## Magic and spellmaking

In the magic window:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move through your spells and enchanted items |
| **Enter** | Select the focused spell or item |
| **T** | Cycle the spell's details (effects, cost, chance) |
| **Delete** | Delete the focused spell. Powers, racial and birthsign spells can't be deleted; enchanted items say "You cannot delete this." |
| **Enter** on **Active effects** | Open the list of what's currently affecting you |

When editing an effect while making a spell or enchantment, on a slider
(magnitude, duration, area):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Left / Right** | Adjust by 1 |
| **Ctrl + Left / Right** | Adjust by 10 |
| **Home / End** | Jump to the lowest / highest value |

---

## Alchemy

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move through the name, quantity, filters, apparatus, ingredients and Create |
| **Enter** | Fill or empty an apparatus slot, add an ingredient, or remove one you've chosen |
| **Left / Right** | Change the quantity or filter |
| **E** | Re-read the effects of the potion you're about to make |
| **T** | Cycle an ingredient's details |

---

## Books and scrolls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Previous / next paragraph |
| **Enter** | Take the book, or close it, when on those options |
| **Escape** | Close |

To hear a paragraph again, arrow off it and back on with Up then Down. **R** does
not repeat book text.

A book with no readable text says so — either that it contains only pictures, or
that it's blank.

---

## The journal

**While reading:**

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Previous / next two-page spread |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Previous / next journal entry, read in full even if it runs across a page break |
| **Left / Right** | Back / forward one page |
| **Page Down / Page Up** | Next / previous topic referenced by what you are reading |
| **Enter** | Open the topic you last moved to with Page Down / Page Up |
| **Backspace** | Go back to what you were reading before you opened a topic |
| **T** | Open the topics browser |
| **Q** | Open the quest list |
| **R** | Read the current page or entry again |

**In the topic and quest lists:**

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move through the letters, topics or quests |
| **Enter** | Open the focused entry |
| **Tab / Shift + Tab** | Switch between Topics, Active Quests and All Quests |
| **Backspace** or **Escape** | Go back a level |

In the All Quests list, finished quests are read out as "completed".

Note that **T** opens the topics browser only while *reading*. Once you're in a
list, T goes back to its usual job of reading out extra detail.

Journal text mentions topics you have already discussed, and the game highlights
those words so they can be clicked. **Page Down** and **Page Up** move through
those topics for whatever you are reading, announcing each as "topic, 2 of 5",
and **Enter** opens the one you stopped on and reads it -- the same page you
would reach through the topics browser, but without hunting for it. Which topics
are offered follows you: normally those on the visible page, or, once you have
moved to an entry with **Ctrl + Up / Down**, those in that whole entry. If there
are none, you will hear "no topics referenced". **Backspace** takes you back to
what you were reading before.

So you know whether there is anything to follow, page and entry announcements end
with a count when the text references any topics -- for example "Entry 47 of 56,
3 topics". Nothing is added when there are none.

---

## Saving and loading

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Move through your saves |
| **Enter** | Load, or save to the focused slot |
| **Delete** | Delete the focused save. You'll be asked to confirm, and the save is named. It only works with the cursor on a save in the list — from the name box or a button, nothing happens |

---

## Yes / No questions

Confirmation prompts — deleting a save or a spell, confirming a teleport, and the
game's own warnings. Arrow keys and Tab move between the choices, Enter picks one
and Escape cancels, all as usual.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **R** | Read the question again |

---

## Settings

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Tab / Shift + Tab** | Next / previous settings tab (the tab name is announced) |
| **Up / Down** | Move through the settings |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Jump between sections |
| **Left / Right** | Change the focused setting |
| **Enter** | Activate a button, or start editing a value |

---

## The console

Open the console with the **`** or **~** key. What you type and what it prints
are both spoken. The console takes the keyboard even when another window is
already open, and puts you back where you were when you close it.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Up / Down** | Recall previous commands |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Re-hear previous output, line by line |
| **Ctrl + T** | Make the scanner's selected object the console target — this replaces clicking on an object. Press with nothing selected to clear it |
| **Ctrl + W** | Delete the word before the cursor |
| **Ctrl + U** | Delete from the cursor back to the start of the line |
| **Tab** | Complete the command or name you are typing |

Setting a target announces its **record id** as well as its name — that id is
what you type into commands, so you rarely need to look it up elsewhere.

---

## The launcher

These are the launcher's own keys, not the game's. The launcher is a standard
desktop window, so your screen reader's usual reading and navigation commands
work throughout.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Ctrl + 1** | Data Files page |
| **Ctrl + 2** | Display page |
| **Ctrl + 3** | Settings page |
| **Ctrl + 4** | Import page |
| **Tab / Shift + Tab** | Move between controls, including the four page buttons |
| **Up / Down** | Move through a list |
| **Shift + Up / Down** | Extend the selection to several items |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Content Files tab: move the selected mods up or down the load order |
| **Space** | Tick or untick the focused item |

The four pages can also be reached by tabbing to the buttons at the top of the
window. Earlier versions left those buttons out of the tab order entirely, so
the Display, Settings and Import pages could not be reached from the keyboard
at all.

On the **Content Files** tab, **Ctrl + Up** and **Ctrl + Down** do the same
thing as the Move Up and Move Down buttons beside the list — the shortcut just
saves tabbing back and forth when reordering several mods. The buttons are
disabled when the selection cannot move any further, and reordering is turned
off while the search box has text in it, since files would otherwise move past
neighbours you cannot see.

Content files, data directories and archives that are **not part of the current
content list** are announced with "not in content list" after the name. Sighted
users see these in bold italics.

Each content file is also announced with its **position in the list** — for
example "Tribunal.esm, 2 of 37". Load order is the whole point of that list, and
after a move the position is the only thing that has changed, so this is how you
confirm the move happened. The count reflects what is actually shown, so it
follows the search box when you filter the list.

Note that **Ctrl + Up / Down** normally moves the cursor without changing the
selection in a list like this. On the Content Files tab it reorders instead.
Use **Up / Down** and **Shift + Up / Down** to move and select.

---

## Keys that mean different things

Most keys do one job everywhere. These don't, so they're worth knowing:

| Key | Depends where you are |
| --- | --- |
| **T** | Journal, while reading: open the topics browser. **Everywhere else** (including the journal's own lists): read out extra detail for the focused thing |
| **Delete** | Inventory: drop the item. Magic window: delete the spell. Save/Load: delete the save. While typing: delete a character |
| **Tab** | Settings: next tab. Journal lists: switch between Topics and Quests. Elsewhere: switch between side-by-side panes |
| **E** | Your inventory: your encumbrance. A companion's: theirs. Alchemy: re-read the potion's effects |
| **Ctrl + Left / Right** | Inventory: change category filter. Editing a spell effect: adjust a slider by 10. In the world: turn to the next compass point |
| **Ctrl + Up / Down** | Journal, while reading: move by journal entry. Conversations: jump to an unexhausted topic. In the world, Ctrl+Up is the direction filter and Ctrl+Down turns you around. In menus: jump between sections. In the launcher's Content Files tab: move a mod up or down the load order |
| **Up / Down** | Journal, while reading: turn a page spread. Books: move by paragraph. Elsewhere: move between options |
| **Enter** | In the world: face the target. Accessible HUD: open the active-effects row. Your inventory: equip or use the item. Container or companion: move the item across. Barter: choose how many. Save/Load: load, or overwrite. Menus: activate the option, or start editing a text box |
| **R** | Conversations, the journal while reading, a Yes/No message box, the class quiz: repeat what was just spoken. Menus, lists and books: nothing — arrow off the row and back instead. In the world: Morrowind's own ready / put away magic |
| **Home** | In the world: repeat the target. Accessible HUD: re-read the current row. Menus and submenus: jump to the first option. On a slider: lowest value. While typing: start of the line |
| **End** | Menus and submenus: jump to the last option. In the world: clear the selection. On a slider: highest value. While typing: end of the line |
| **Escape** | While typing: stop editing. In a submenu: close the submenu. Journal lists: go back a level. Otherwise: close the window |

---

## A note on conflicts with Morrowind's own controls

The accessibility keys mostly use keys Morrowind leaves free — the number row
with Ctrl, Page Up and Page Down, the arrow keys with Ctrl, and so on. A few are
plain letters (**H**, **K**, **X**, **I**, **L**, **N**). If one of these clashes
with something you've rebound, you can change your own binding in the game's
controls settings; the accessibility keys themselves are fixed for now.

**R** repeats a spoken *passage or prompt* — a conversation line, a journal page
or entry, a Yes/No message box, or a class-quiz question. It does **not** repeat
menu rows, list items or book paragraphs: to hear one of those again, arrow off
it and back on. In the world (outside any menu) R stays Morrowind's own "ready /
put away magic"; to hear the last thing spoken while you're playing, use
**Home**.
