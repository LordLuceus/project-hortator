    /// Per-window screen-reader controller. A MyGUI window owns one of these as

    /// the entire interaction model once:
    ///
    ///  - Up/Down      move between registered options (skipping hidden ones)
    ///  - Left/Right   change the current option's value
    ///  - Enter/Space  activate the current option, or expand it if it is an
    ///                 expandable submenu (Element::children)
    ///  - T / Shift+T  cycle the current option's tooltips forward / backward
    ///  - Escape       collapse an open submenu back to the main screen
    ///  - a 2s linger announces how many tooltips the current option has, or
    ///                 "Press Enter to expand" for an expandable submenu
    ///
    /// Expandable submenus: an option whose Element::children is set becomes a
    /// nested list. Enter opens it; Up/Down then move between child items (the
    /// section name is spoken when focus crosses into a new section, e.g.
    /// "Major Skills: Alteration"); Ctrl+Up/Down jump between sections; Home/End
    /// jump to the first/last item; T cycles a child's tooltips; Escape returns
    /// to the main screen on the option you expanded.

    ///  - Real focus (default): each option widget actually receives MyGUI key
    ///    focus as you navigate. Good for screens whose widgets are passive
    ///    focus proxies (e.g. text headings).
    ///  - Virtual focus (setVirtualFocus): real key focus is pinned to a single
    ///    anchor widget and never moves; option widgets are made non-focusable
    ///    so native controls (ListBox/ComboBox/ScrollBar) can't grab the arrow
    ///    keys. Navigation is purely internal. Good for screens built from
    ///    native widgets.
