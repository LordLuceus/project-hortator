        //     jump/strafe is warranted. A normal navmesh detour around a wall
        //     still moves the body at full speed, so it never trips this, which
        //     is what kills the spurious jumping on clean ground.
        //

        //    we are in fact advancing, so the route remainder is the honest
        //    signal there ("we are consuming the planned path").
        //
        //  - STRAIGHT-LINE DISTANCE TO THE TRUE TARGET. On a long OUTDOOR walk
        //    only a cell or two of navmesh is loaded ahead, so the planned route
        //    is PARTIAL and its far end RECEDES as new terrain streams in (in
        //    progressive mode the "carrot" does this explicitly; in normal mode
        //    the partial-path end does it implicitly). The route remainder then
        //    plateaus -- we run at full speed but the route end runs away just as
        //    fast -- so path-length alone never improves and the 10 s backstop

        //    closing on the target. Goal-distance is the honest signal there.

        // for targets high overhead --------------------------------------------
        //
        // While airborne (Levitation, a flying creature form), the plain ground
        // walker fails: it only steers yaw, so it flies dead-level into arches and
        // never climbs to a raised target. The base behaviour reuses the navmesh
        // pathfinder wholesale -- it already solves 3D mazes like the Vivec Puzzle
        // Canal, where you must route AROUND walls, not climb over them -- and only
        // changes HOW we follow it: aim the player's absolute orientation (yaw AND
        // pitch, via rotateObject as lock-on uses) at the next waypoint and push
        // forward. The engine's flight velocity = orientation * forward then
        // carries us up/down along the route's elevation profile.
        //
        // But the navmesh only covers the GROUND, so for a target sitting high on a
        // raised dais (Divayth Fyr atop his tower core, a shrine on a ledge) every
        // waypoint is at floor level: following them skims the player along the
        // ground to the base of the structure, then the route runs out and a
        // bee-line aims up at the target -- from DIRECTLY UNDER the dais lip, where
        // solid geometry overhead blocks any rise and the player just wedges. The
        // fix is to gain altitude EARLY, out in the open where there's headroom,
        // then cruise in level above the lip: when the target is well above us and
        // a straight-up raycast shows real clearance overhead, override pitch to
        // climb steeply instead of tracking the ground waypoints. The climb angle
        // eases as we near the target's height (proportional, so we settle at the
        // right altitude instead of overshooting), and once we're level with or
        // above the target the override releases and normal waypoint-following
        // flies us in. If we're boxed in with no headroom (genuinely under an
        // overhang) the override never engages, the route runs out, and stuck
        // detection arms the teleport escape hatch -- the honest fallback.
